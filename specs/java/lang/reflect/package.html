<title>JML Specifications of JDK Types</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

<p>
JML Specifications for the corresponding types in the Java
Developement Kit (JDK).
These specifications are intended for use in reasoning about
specifications in the JDK, but are not endorsed by
Sun Microsystems, Inc. in any way.
The syntactic interfaces of the methods are copyright
Sun Microsystems, Inc.
</p>

<h2>Specification Conventions</h2>

<P>
Specifications in <kbd>.spec</kbd> files should be interfaces, and these are
compiled with JML's runtime assertion checking compiler (jmlc) to
yield surrogate class files that are in the release.
Other specifications should normally be found in <kbd>.jml</kbd>
or <kbd>.refines-spec</kbd> files.
</p>

<p>
The specifications necessarily start with the Java interfaces, but we
never include the javadoc comments or code from the JDK, since that
would violate copyright restrictions.
</p>

<p>
The source code for this package uses the GNU Lesser General Public
License, since it is part of the JML runtime libraries.
</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>
These types were designed by Sun Microsystems.
</p>

<p>
At Iowa State, the development of JML was partially funded by
a grant from <A HREF="http://www.rockwell.com/">
Rockwell International Corporation</A>
and by
the (US)
<A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</A>
under grants CCR-9503168, CCR-9803843, CCR-0097907, and CCR-0113181.
